    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz rotini pasta</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 oz cream cheese brick</li>
        <li>12 oz evaporated milk</li>

        <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water and the olive oil to a boil. Add the 
            dry rotini noodles and cook according to the package directions, 
            which is usually on a rolling boil for 10-12 minutes until al dente. 
            Remove from the heat and drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the same time, in a large saucepan or dutch oven, add your 
            cream cheese, evaporated milk, milk, and shredded cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the same time, in a large saucepan or dutch oven, add your 
            cream cheese, evaporated milk, milk, and shredded cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the creamy sauce has melted and thickened, add in the 
            cooked macaroni noodles and allow the mixture to heat through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Distribute the mac and cheese into separate bowls or a large serving 
            dish and add the french fried onions to the top of the macaroni.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure that you’ve added a good portion of the crunchy toppings to 
            each bowl! The crispy onions are meant to complement this creamy dish, 
            so this is an important step.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately with a little bit of black pepper (if desired) and enjoy!
        </li>
